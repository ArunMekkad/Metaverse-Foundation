# Metaverse-Foundation
This is a PC application which can serve as a base for Metaverse development on Unity 3D. 

The Metaverse Foundation application runs on any windows PC and it acts as a basic multiplayer setup with features like avatar spawning, voice chat, text chat, movement animations and so on. The application can be tested either by running multiple instances on the same PC or running the application on different systems. The multiplayer setup is added with the help of Photon Unity Networking Engine. 

The application starts up with a basic workflow which enables the user to select a name of choice, create and/or join rooms. On clicking "Play", the people in the same room gets assigned with a default avatar and gets spawned in an environment which is collaborative on both ends. The voice chat is also enabled by default.

The application is still in development mode and requires further polishing. Few glitches can be expected.
